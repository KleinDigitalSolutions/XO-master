### 💡 Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

- **Clear description** of the feature
- **Use case** - why is this valuable?
- **Implementation ideas** (optional)
- **Mockups or examples** (optional)

**Example:**
```markdown
## Feature: Batch Audio Processing

**Description:**
Allow users to upload multiple audio files and process them in a queue.

**Use Case:**
Musicians often need to process entire albums (10-15 tracks). Currently, they must upload files one by one, which is time-consuming.

**Proposed Implementation:**
- Add "Upload Multiple" button
- Show queue UI with progress indicators
- Process files sequentially on Modal
- Download all results as ZIP

**Benefits:**
- Saves user time
- Increases credit usage per session
- Improves user experience
```

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript / Frontend

**Style Guide:**
- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- 2-space indentation
- Semicolons required
- Single quotes for strings
- Meaningful variable names

**Example:**
```javascript
// ✅ Good
const audioService = {
  async processAudio(file, options) {
    const formData = new FormData()
    formData.append('file', file)

    try {
      const response = await fetch(ENDPOINT, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
      })
      return await response.json()
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Processing failed:', error)
      throw error
    }
  }
}

// ❌ Bad
var audioService={processAudio:function(file,options){formData=new FormData();formData.append("file",file);fetch(ENDPOINT,{method:"POST",body:formData}).then(r=>r.json())}}
```

### Python / Backend

**Style Guide:**
- Follow PEP 8
- 4-space indentation
- Type hints for function signatures
- Docstrings for all functions
- Max line length: 100 characters

**Example:**
```python
# ✅ Good
def separate_audio(
    audio_bytes: bytes,
    model: str = "bs_roformer",
    segment_size: int = 25
) -> dict[str, bytes]:
    """
    Separates audio into stems using specified model.

    Args:
        audio_bytes: Input audio file as bytes
        model: Model name (bs_roformer, htdemucs, etc.)
        segment_size: Segment size for processing (larger = better quality)

    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping stem names to audio bytes

    Raises:
        ValueError: If model is not supported
        RuntimeError: If GPU processing fails
    """
    if model not in SUPPORTED_MODELS:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported model: {model}")

    try:
        stems = model.separate(audio_bytes, segment_size=segment_size)
        return stems
    except torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError:
        logger.warning("GPU OOM, retrying with smaller segments")
        return model.separate(audio_bytes, segment_size=15)

# ❌ Bad
def separate(a,m="bs_roformer",s=25):
    return m.separate(a,s)
```

### SQL / Database

**Style Guide:**
- UPPERCASE keywords
- Lowercase table/column names
- Indent nested queries
- Always use explicit JOIN syntax

**Example:**
```sql
-- ✅ Good
SELECT
    u.id,
    u.email,
    u.credits,
    COUNT(p.id) AS total_purchases,
    SUM(p.credits) AS lifetime_credits
FROM credit_users u
LEFT JOIN credit_purchases p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE u.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY u.id, u.email, u.credits
ORDER BY lifetime_credits DESC;

-- ❌ Bad
select * from credit_users,credit_purchases where credit_users.id=credit_purchases.user_id;
```

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Testing

```javascript
// Example: Test credit manager
describe('CreditManager', () => {
  let creditManager

  beforeEach(() => {
    creditManager = new CreditManager()
  })

  test('should fetch user balance', async () => {
    const balance = await creditManager.getBalance('user_123')
    expect(balance.credits).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0)
  })

  test('should deduct credits after service use', async () => {
    const before = await creditManager.getBalance('user_123')
    await creditManager.deductCredits('user_123', 'separation', 'job_456')
    const after = await creditManager.getBalance('user_123')
    expect(after.credits).toBe(before.credits - 1)
  })
})
```

### Backend Testing

```python
# Example: Test Modal function
import pytest
from modal_app_zfturbo_complete import separate_audio

def test_separate_audio_success():
    """Test audio separation with valid input."""
    with open('test_audio.mp3', 'rb') as f:
        audio_bytes = f.read()

    result = separate_audio(audio_bytes, model='bs_roformer')

    assert 'vocals' in result
    assert 'drums' in result
    assert 'bass' in result
    assert 'other' in result
    assert len(result['vocals']) > 0

def test_separate_audio_invalid_model():
    """Test error handling for invalid model."""
    with open('test_audio.mp3', 'rb') as f:
        audio_bytes = f.read()

    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Unsupported model"):
        separate_audio(audio_bytes, model='invalid_model')
```

### Integration Testing

```bash
# Test full payment flow
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/create-checkout-session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"packageType":"starter"}'

# Test webhook handling
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed

# Verify credit allocation
curl http://localhost:3000/api/credits?userId=user_123
```

## Documentation

### Code Comments

**When to comment:**
- Complex algorithms
- Non-obvious business logic
- Performance optimizations
- Workarounds for known issues

**Example:**
```javascript
// Process audio in segments to avoid GPU memory overflow
// Segment size of 25 provides optimal quality-speed tradeoff on A10G
const SEGMENT_SIZE = 25

// Use 2 shifts for ensemble prediction (improves SDR by ~0.5dB)
// See: https://github.com/ZFTurbo/MSSR/issues/42
const NUM_SHIFTS = 2
```

### API Documentation

Use JSDoc/docstrings for all public functions:

```javascript
/**
 * Processes audio file through AI separation service
 *
 * @param {File} audioFile - Audio file to process
 * @param {Object} options - Processing options
 * @param {string} options.model - Model name (bs_roformer, htdemucs)
 * @param {number} options.segmentSize - Segment size (default: 25)
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Separated audio stems
 * @throws {Error} If processing fails or credits insufficient
 *
 * @example
 * const stems = await processAudio(file, {
 *   model: 'bs_roformer',
 *   segmentSize: 25
 * })
 */
async function processAudio(audioFile, options) {
  // Implementation
}
```
